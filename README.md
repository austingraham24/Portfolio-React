This is a repository where I am trying to write my own portfolio site from scratch using react-redux.
I am using Stephen Griders ReduxSimpleStarterPackage as the jumping off point.
That repo can be found here: https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter
Also for learning react and redux check out his udemy courses here: https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/

to run this locally, clone or download the zip file. 
Make sure you have node and npm installed on your machine.
cd into the project folder.
now run:
***
> npm install
> npm start
***
